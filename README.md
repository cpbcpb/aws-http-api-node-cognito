# AWS Node HTTP API with Cognito Authorizer

I'm building my first app in the serverless framework and I'm adding a service to use AWS Cognito.  This repo is for that service.  I modified the code here from: https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-auth-with-aws-http-apis/.  The original example code is here:  https://github.com/fernando-mc/aws-http-api-node-cognito.git

## USES

- AWS HTTP API (Announced Dec. 2019) and the built in 
- JSON Web Token Authorization it offers. 
- Amazon Cognito.
